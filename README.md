# MEDP33100 - Project 1 Interactive Storytelling

## Live Demo

- Include a link to the live version of the project hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Project Overview

- Briefly describe the purpose of the project.
- Explain the story you are telling through the webpage and the key interactive elements.

the purpose of this project was that I wanted to tell a story through the use of interactive elements such as buttons and as well as messing around with the text, changing the font size, the way the text comes onto the page and even the background how all of that can effect the environment that you are in when you are experiencing the story 

## Figma Design

- Provide a link to the Figma design of the webpage.

## Features

- List the key features of the project, including:
    - **Animations**: Describe the animations you implemented (e.g., CSS transitions, GSAP effects).
    - **Sound Effects**: Specify where sound effects are used and how they enhance the user experience.
    - **User-triggered Events**: Explain how users interact with the page (e.g., clicking, scrolling, hovering) and how the page responds.
    - **Responsive Design**: Explain how the design adapts to different devices (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile).

    I used different types of split animations for the text, so that there would be an effect where the text can be split up by individual words, or individual characters or also lines that are grouped together to add a bit of an effect into the story as well. Saldy due to time constraints there wasn't many sound effects that I couldv'e added but would've loved to if I could. user triggered events is definetly the clicking of the buttons and hovering over the buttons where the user would hover over and there would be a glow that would signifiy that this is the button that you can click on. There was also the aspect of the responive design where I would lower the font of the text so that when you are on smaller screens, the big text doesn't overwhelm the phone and have everything else overflow. So i can change the font size so that everything still stays central

## Technologies Used

- List the technologies and tools used in the project:
    - **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    - **Libraries**: (e.g., GSAP for animations)
    - **Other**: GitHub Pages for hosting, Figma for design

    languages used: HTML, CSS, Js
    Libraries: GSAP
    Other: GitHub, Figma

## Credits

- List any third-party assets used in the project (e.g., sound effects, images, fonts) and provide proper attribution.
- Acknowledge any resources, tutorials, or references you used to help complete the project.

There is a website, called codewithrandom.com where I grabbed a piece of coding for the static background! they had multiple ones to offer but that one since it had a bit of static and horror-ish element to it, I really liked it and chose that as well. There is another one that I got from office hours that helped with the button to create the little glow effect that I enjoyed it was from universe.io/buttons and also gsap animation with the split text to ensure that it comes in nicely. There is also the color generator website called coolers where it generates or you can select different colour palletes to choose from and you can copy and paste their hex code! https://coolors.co/

## Future Enhancements

- I wish I could have added way more to the backgrounds, I think there could have been a lot done there however, I do like the static effect throughout the entire story although I wish it was a little better with background and especially sound design, that is something that I wasn't able to get to due to time constraints.
